            <left><p id="x">He is the most well known rapper of BGMedia. He has had some very controversial songs such as his first song “Roadrage” and his collaboration with Dylan Brewer “Afghan Dan business” where he calls Dan a rascal slur. He says he sends for everyone as it will gain him respect as he just wants to be the best at what he does.
            Little T has said he wants to be on 1Xtra(a radio station). His first song, “Roadrage”, was very controversial as some of the slurs he says are considered over the top and out of line. 
            At first Josh's mother didn’t back hi after hearing his first song but once she seen how beneficial it was she let him continue and backed him. She not has one problem with his career, and that’s the abuse he gets from youtubers. His Dad at first wasn’t happy either but eventually realised it was good for his son.
            Little T loves riding dirt bikes get away from his popularity, he said it gives him a chance to be normal. 
            He doesn’t like his popularity in a sense as he can’t go many places without being noticed and being harassed.</p></left>
