            <h2>BGMedia</>
            <p id="x">blackpool grime exploded over a year and a half ago. Most of the people featured on the channel are only about 12-13 like Clarko and Little T. There are also many people featured on the channel that are much older such as Dylan Brewer and Callyman Sam. The biggest names on BGMedia include Little T, Sophie Aspin and Afghan Dan.
People see Blackpool grime to be very similar to what grime was when it first began years ago. There is a lot of poverty in Blackpool and people do grime to escape their problems and just to have some fun, some people say that this gives them meaning as they weren’t good in school. A few of the artists have came out and said they were bullied when they were in school like Afghan dan and soph Aspin. This area of grime isn’t well funded and is usually made in someone’s room. Most of the kids who do this have a dream of being a music artist and do this because they need to start somewhere. Most of the songs get millions of views. The group of artists on BGM have gotten abuse from many piss taking youtube’s.
